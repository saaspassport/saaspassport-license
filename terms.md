# SaaS Passport License

Development Draft

## Purpose

This license gives you legal permission to use, share, and make changes to this version of the SaaS Passport terms and forms for software-as-a-service sales.

## Agreement

In order to receive this license, you have to agree to its rules with Artless Devices LLC, the company behind SaaS Passport.  Those rules are both obligations under our agreement and conditions to your license.

## Fees

***If you use this version of SaaS Passport to close a deal, pay us our current fee via <https://saaspassport.com/pay> within two business days.  Pay the fee for each deal you close, whether you use our terms as published, use our terms with changes, or copy significant chunks of our terms into your own.***

This isn't a donation.  It isn't a tip.  You owe us the money.  We don't lock down access to SaaS Passport, burden it with DRM, or surveil our users.  We require you to agree to these rules.  Then we trust you'll follow them.

## Use

We license you under copyright law to make and share copies of this version of SaaS Passport, and to make changes to and other works based on it, under these rules:

1.  Don't remove any of our notes about about copyrights, trademarks, or license terms.  Wherever our terms go, those notes must go.

2.  If you make changes, other than just filling out forms as instructed, clarify that your version is no longer the same as SaaS Passport.  Replace the SaaS Passport branding with a note that your version is "based on SaaS Passport", "includes terms from SaaS Passport", or similar, and adapt our notes about copyrights, trademarks, and license terms accordingly.  We do not give you any license under trademark to use our marks or logos.

3.  Don't republish our terms or forms, especially on the open Internet.  Link to them on saaspassport.com instead.

## Fair Use

This license doesn't limit any rights you may have under copyright "fair use" or trademark "nominative use".

## Reliability

We expect you to rely on this license.  We won't revoke it.  However, we may publish new versions of SaaS Passport under new and different terms.

## Side Deals

If your use of this version of SaaS Passport is covered by another, separate deal, then that deal, not this license, governs your use.

For example, if your company has a deal with us for use of SaaS Passport with customers for a flat fee per month, you don't have to pay our published fee for those customers under this license, as well.

## California

If we end up suing each out about anything related to this version of SaaS Passport or this license, we agree to take it to federal or state court in [Oakland, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California).  California law will govern.  The loser will pay the winner's attorney's fees and costs.

We know you're probably not in Oakland.  But we can't know what this license means without pinning down what law governs.  There are a lot of potential SaaS Passport users, everywhere, and just one Artless Devices.  If users could sue us in a thousand different places, we could go bankrupt just buying plane tickets.

## Liability

***As far as the law allows, SaaS Passport comes as is, without any warranty.  There is just one exception: we guarantee that we have the copyrights needed to license SaaS Passport.  Otherwise, as far as the law allows, neither Artless Devices nor any contributor to SaaS Passport will be liable for any damages related to SaaS Passport or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Not Your Lawyer

***We are licensing you terms and forms, not offering any kind of attorney-client relationship.  We won't be professionally responsible to you as a lawyer would, even if you reach out to us with questions or feedback.***
